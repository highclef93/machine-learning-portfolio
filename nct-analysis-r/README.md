## **Project Showcase: NCT Vehicle Roadworthiness Test Analysis (2021)**  

### **📌 Overview**  
This project analyzes the **National Car Test (NCT)** pass/fail rates for vehicles in Ireland (2021), exploring trends in vehicle performance, brand reliability, and test correlations. The goal was to extract meaningful insights using **R, ggplot2, dplyr, and interactive visualization techniques** to help stakeholders (consumers, manufacturers, policymakers) make data-driven decisions.

## **💻 Key R Code Snippets**  

### **1. Data Cleaning & Aggregation**  
```r
# Combine Vehicle Make, Model, and Year into a single identifier  
vehicle.data$vehicle <- paste(  
  vehicle.data$`Vehicle Make`,  
  vehicle.data$`Vehicle Model`,  
  vehicle.data$`Year Of Birth`,  
  sep = "-"  
)  

# Calculate Pass/Fail Rates  
df_vehicle_pass_fail <- vehicle.data %>%  
  group_by(`Vehicle Make`) %>%  
  summarise(  
    Total = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE),  
    Pass = sum(PASS, na.rm = TRUE),  
    Fail = sum(FAIL, na.rm = TRUE),  
    Pass_Rate = Pass / Total * 100  
  )  
```  

### **2. Interactive Visualization with `ggplotly`**  
```r
# Interactive Bar Plot of Pass Rates  
pass_rate_plot <- df_vehicle_pass_fail %>%  
  mutate(`Vehicle Make` = fct_reorder(`Vehicle Make`, Pass_Rate)) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = `Vehicle Make`, y = Pass_Rate, fill = `Vehicle Make`)) +  
  geom_col(width = 0.8) +  
  coord_flip() +  
  labs(title = "NCT Pass Rates by Vehicle Make (2021)")  

# Convert to interactive plot  
pass_rate_plot %>% ggplotly()  
```  

### **3. Correlation Analysis**  
```r
# Compute Correlation Matrix  
cor_matrix <- cor(  
  vehicle.data[, c("PASS %", "Vehicle and Safety Equipment %", "Brake Test %")],  
  method = "spearman"  
)  

# Visualize with `corrplot`  
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", addCoef.col = "white")  
```  

### **4. Animated Bar Plot (Top 10 Brands)**  
```r
# Animated Plot with `gganimate`  
animated_plot <- Top10.popular.cars %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = `Vehicle Make`, y = `Pass.rate(%)`, fill = `Vehicle Make`)) +  
  geom_col() +  
  transition_states(`Vehicle Make`, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1)  

animate(animated_plot, fps = 6)  
```  

### **5. Geospatial Mapping (Test Centers)**  
```r
# Plot Test Centers on Ireland Map  
ggplot() +  
  geom_sf(data = ireland_map, fill = "white", color = "black") +  
  geom_point(  
    data = test_centers,  
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = Test_Centre),  
    size = 4  
  ) +  
  labs(title = "Top 5 Driving Test Centers in Ireland")  
```
